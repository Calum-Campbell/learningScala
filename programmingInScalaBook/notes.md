args takes the command line input. E.g scala hello.scala one two, will run the hello.scala file, and args = [one, two].

You can say “in” for the <- symbol. You’d read for (arg <- args), therefore, as “for arg in args.”

```
 for (arg <- args)    println(arg)
    
```

lists are immutable series of objects
